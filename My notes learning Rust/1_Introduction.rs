// About Rust :
// *   **Empowerment:** Rust empowers you to reach farther and program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than before.
// *   **Safe Systems Programming:** It breaks down traditional barriers in systems-level work, allowing low-level control without the customary risks of crashes, security holes, or complex toolchains.
// *   **Reliable & Efficient Code:** The language is designed to guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
// *   **Enhanced Low-Level Development:** For programmers already working with low-level code, Rust enables higher ambitions, such as low-risk parallelism (with compiler assistance) and confident optimization without introducing vulnerabilities.
// *   **Versatility Beyond Systems:** Rust is expressive and ergonomic enough for a wide range of applications, including CLI apps, web servers, and more, with skills that transfer across domains.
// *   **Learning & Growth:** This book aims to level up not just your knowledge of Rust, but also your general reach and confidence as a programmer.
