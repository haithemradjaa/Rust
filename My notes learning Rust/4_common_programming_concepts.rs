// In Rust, variables are immutable by default.
// This design choice promotes safety and easier concurrency.
// To make a variable mutable, the `mut` keyword must be used before its name, for example: `let mut x = 5;`.
// Attempting to reassign an immutable variable will result in a compile-time error (E0384).
// This error helps prevent bugs where one part of the code assumes a value won't change while another part modifies it.
// While immutability is favored, mutability can be convenient and signals intent to future readers of the code.
//
// Constants are similar to immutable variables but have key differences.
// They are always immutable and cannot use `mut`.
// Constants are declared using the `const` keyword instead of `let`.
// Their type must always be explicitly annotated, for example: `const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`.
// Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope.
// They can only be set to a constant expression, not the result of a value computed at runtime.
// Rust's naming convention for constants is all uppercase with underscores between words.
// Constants are useful for application-specific values that multiple parts of the program might need to know about.
// They also provide a single point of modification for hardcoded values.
//
// Shadowing allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous one by using the `let` keyword again.
// The new variable effectively "shadows" the old one, meaning the compiler will see the new variable.
// Shadowing is different from using `mut` in two important ways:
// 1. Shadowing allows you to perform transformations on a value and then have the variable be immutable after those transformations are complete. If you try to reassign without `let`, you'll get a compile-time error.
// 2. Shadowing allows you to change the type of the value while reusing the same name (e.g., converting a string of spaces to a number representing its length).
// Using `mut` for a type change would result in a compile-time error (E0308) because `mut` does not allow changing a variable's type.
// Shadowing helps avoid the need for different variable names like `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`.

// Every value in Rust has a data type, which tells Rust how to work with it.
// Rust is a statically typed language, meaning types are known at compile time.
// The compiler usually infers types, but explicit type annotations like `: u32`
// are needed when multiple types are possible, for example, with `parse()`.
//
// Data types are categorized into two subsets: scalar and compound.
//
// Scalar Types represent a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
// - Integers: Numbers without fractional components.
//   - Signed (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128) can be positive or negative.
//   - Unsigned (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128) are only positive.
//   - `isize` and `usize` are architecture-dependent (32 or 64 bits) and are
//     primarily used for indexing collections.
//   - The default integer type is i32.
//   - Integer literals can be decimal (98_222), hex (0xff), octal (0o77),
//     binary (0b1111_0000), or byte (b'A', u8 only). Underscores `_` can be
//     used for readability (e.g., 1_000).
//   - Integer overflow: In debug mode, it causes a program panic. In release
//     mode, it performs two's complement wrapping. Explicit handling methods
//     like `wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, and `saturating_*`
//     are available for primitive numeric types.
// - Floating-point numbers: Numbers with decimal points.
//   - `f32` (32-bit) and `f64` (64-bit). The default is f64 for precision.
//   - All floating-point types are signed and follow the IEEE-754 standard.
// - Booleans: The `bool` type, with values `true` or `false`. They are one
//   byte in size and are commonly used in conditional expressions.
// - Characters: The `char` type, specified with single quotes (e.g., 'z', 'ðŸ˜»').
//   They are four bytes in size and represent a Unicode Scalar Value, allowing
//   for a wide range of characters beyond ASCII.
//
// Numeric Operations: Rust supports standard mathematical operations: addition,
// subtraction, multiplication, division (integer division truncates toward zero),
// and remainder.
//
// Compound Types group multiple values into one type:
// - Tuples: A fixed-length way to group values of different types into a single
//   compound type.
//   - Created by a comma-separated list inside parentheses: `(500, 6.4, 1)`.
//   - Values can be extracted using pattern matching (destructuring):
//     `let (x, y, z) = tup;`.
//   - Elements can also be accessed directly by index: `tup.0`, `tup.1`.
//   - The empty tuple `()` is called "unit" and represents an empty value or
//     an empty return type.
// - Arrays: A fixed-length collection where all elements must have the same type.
//   - Values are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:
//     `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
//   - Array types are specified as `[type; length]` (e.g., `[i32; 5]`).
//   - Arrays can be initialized with a repeated value: `[3; 5]` creates an
//     array of five 3s.
//   - Elements are accessed by index: `a[0]`.
//   - Accessing an array element with an index that is out of bounds will cause
//     the program to panic at runtime, ensuring memory safety by preventing
//     access to invalid memory locations.
//   - For collections that can grow or shrink in size, the `Vec` (vector) type
//     from the standard library is generally preferred over arrays.
